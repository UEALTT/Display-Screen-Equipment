			<text>Introduction
Sitting at your desk in your office is not a natural posture, yet many people at the University can spend several hours a day working at their computer workstations.

It is important that these workstations are set up correctly for each individual user, so that they do not experience any pain or discomfort while working or after such work. Your workstation should be able to be adapted to suit you. You should not have to adapt how you need to sit to suit an unacceptable workstation.

There are a number of known health risks that are associated with the use of computer workstations. You will have heard of cases of Repetitive Strain Injury, or RSI. These conditions are nowadays referred to as Work Related Upper Limb Disorders or WRULDs as they affect the arms and shoulders. You may have suffered from one of the conditions that come under this umbrella term yourself, or know a friend or colleague who has. In severe cases, these conditions can be severely disabling, resulting in individuals having to give up work.</text>

			<text>However, working at a poorly set up workstation does not mean that you will develop such a severe condition. We all have different susceptibilities to such harm. Some people can work in poor conditions for years without apparent problems and others can succumb to injury within a few weeks.

The important things are that you are provided with appropriate equipment which is adjustable to your needs, that you know how to adjust your workstation to provide you with your optimum posture and that you know to act to readjust it, or to seek help and advice, on your feeling discomfort while working.

Discomfort and pain are not necessarily indicators of harm. However, if you act early on noticing them, then you will be more productive while working and not suffer disruption to your private life from aches and pains derived from work.

Please now read through ALL of the sections and complete the Course Test at the end.

			<text>Legislation was introduced in 1992 to address the health conditions that had been recognised from using computer equipment.

In many ways it was far-sighted law, as in the early 1990's far fewer people than today would have worked with computers and very few would have worked with them for significant periods.

			<text>The legislation places requirements on the minimum requirements for a workstation, on assessment of workstations and on the provision of information and instruction.

There are some minimum requirements for a display screen workstation and these can be found here. However, these are the minimum requirements and your workstation also needs to be assessed for its suitability for you.

			<text>Let's look at the set up of a workstation. The place to start is with your chair. Your chair supports your posture and places you at your workstation.

A chair such as this in the photograph is not suitable for a computer workstation. The seat is not adjustable in height, its backrest is not adjustable, it does not swivel and it does not have casters - so it does not provide easy freedom of movement.

			<text>Your chair should look something like the one displayed here. Arms on chairs are not needed - and they cost extra if you order a new chair. Also they can prevent people getting close enough to their desks. If you have arms on your chair and they are stopping you sitting properly at your desk, just get rid of them.

Your chair should have a stable 5 star base.

			<text>Your chair should provide good support for your back. Your back has natural curves and these should supported by the chair back. The small of your back curves into your body and the chair has a shape that is designed to fit into this curve. You need to adjust the height of the backrest to achieve this.

Adjusting this chair it is just a matter of releasing a locking wheel at the base of the chair's spine and adjusting the height. 

Your chair may have a different adjusting arrangement. The chair manufacturer will have provided instructions on how your chair can be adjusted. If you have problems adjusting your chair please ask for help.

			<text>Standard office furniture is designed to fit a range of sizes either side of an averagely sized individual. A few individuals will find that the range of height adjustment of the backrest is not sufficient for them - if this includes you then you will need to have a non-standard chair that adjusts to meet your needs. Chair manufacturers stock large ranges of chairs to meet all needs.

The preferred suppliers of office furniture for the University can be found on the Finance intranet pages.

			<text>To complete the adjustment of your chair you need to adjust the seat height. The position of your hands at the keyboard defines the height at which your seat needs to be - not whether your feet touch the ground.

Your forearms and wrists should be approximately horizontal at the keying position at the keyboard. 

If you have the seat too high or too low, your wrists will be flexed - this may be tiring and result in discomfort.

			<text>If after adjusting your chair you find that your feet do not comfortably touch the ground then you will need a footrest.

If you have difficulty retaining your back's position in the backrest due to gradual slipping forward then you also may benefit from a footrest, which will help you support your position against the backrest.

The front of the seat should have a rolled edge. This avoids pressure on the backs of your legs.

Do not let it become such a store for office items that your legs are constrained from being able to move freely. Some of the old writing desks have narrow gaps between their drawer units - for many people these do not provide sufficient leg room.

			<text>Adjust the Height and Angle
Ideally, the top of the screen should be at the same height as your eyes. Your eyes naturally look down about 15 to 20 degrees when relaxed, so this screen position means that you will be comfortably looking at the screen. Many people find that a screen position lower than this is more comfortable for them. Do not, however, have your screen higher than this or you may begin to experience discomfort in your neck or shoulders.

Adjust the screen angle to face you - this is particularly important with some of the larger screens that some people have these days. We have had a user who reported feeling queasy at the end of the day after regularly using a large screen - the screen was too vertical and the problem was solved by simply angling it to face him.

			<text>The lighting environment of your workstation needs to be appropriate to the work that you are doing. Working at a computer is unlikely to harm your eyes but a poor light environment may cause you to develop tired eyes or eye strain.

You may have difficulty focusing, causing you to lean forward or bend your head forwards. All the good work that you did in establishing a good posture in your chair could be lost and as a result, develop musculoskeletal discomfort.

When using a computer, you are looking at a screen that is a fairly low level light source. You do not want to be trying to concentrate on that screen in either too bright a light environment or too low a light environment.

This means that the artificial lighting provided at your workstation must provide you with at least 300 lux (remember there will be no daylight in your office in the late afternoon in December). If you have doubts about the adequacy of the level of light at your computer workstation please contact Safety Services so that we can check it with a light meter.
Your Environment- Artificial Lighting
Lighting can be improved by using a local light source such as an anglepoise lamp.

However, these are not without problems as you are bringing a bright light source close to you. Be careful not to have the bulb of such a unit within your eyesight while working - also be wary of causing yourself glare problems from light from such lamps reflecting off the desk surface or papers. Often one can best illuminate a workstation by reflecting light into the workstation from another source, such as a back wall.</text>

			<text>Never have your computer screen in front of a window. Even on an overcast day, the light from the sky is very bright compared to the low light output of your monitor screen.

Direct sunlight falling on to your desk and reflecting off the surface will also be too bright a light source. If the office you are working in is adversely impacted by sunlight ingress, you should be provided with adjustable blinds on the window to control the sunlight coming in.

			<text>Modern flat screens are less reflective than the old cathode ray tube monitors, so they do not produce many reflective problems. However, if you have a very bright light source behind you (such as a window) you may experience reflective glare problems. Try small adjustments to the position of your screen - if that does not work you may need to move the position of your whole workstation.

Adjusting the brightness of your monitor with changing light conditions can improve visual comfort - also keep the screen clean using cleaning materials recommended by the monitor manufacturer.

			<text>The temperature at your workstation needs to be comfortable. There are no absolute legal limits on temperature, the law merely requires that temperatures are reasonable. The Health and Safety Executive advise that temperatures in offices should be in the range of 16°C to 30°C. In some areas of the University, temperatures will regularly exceed 30°C for periods of a few weeks at the height of summer.

Unless you have a medical condition that can be exacerbated by high temperatures, you are unlikely to be harmed by trying to work in temperatures a few degrees above 30°C - however what you are unlikely to be doing is working much at all. You might as well be sent home.

			<text>Even as temperatures rise above 25°C you are likely to be less and less productive - so raised temperatures are really more of a business productivity issue rather than a health &amp; safety issue. Line Managers need to decide whether high temperatures need to be addressed by intervening (such as hiring air conditioning) to maintain work productivity or even whether there is any point in staff being at work at all.

Even at relatively mild temperatures, an office can feel thermally uncomfortable and stuffy due to lack of air movement. Having a fan available for you to use can make a stuffy room feel fresh if you are too far from an open window to benefit from that.

A fan obviously cannot reduce the temperature, but by causing air movement past the surface of your skin it increases the rate of evaporation of moisture causing a cooling effect. A fan really will make a difference when the summer comes.

			<text>It is important that you take rest breaks. Your posture in your chair will deteriorate the longer you sit in it - you will have noticed this from sitting in meetings, talks or seminars. At the start you feel comfortable, but after a while you find that you are having to shift in the chair to make it more comfortable.

What you really need to do is stand up and stretch and reposition yourself back in the seat in a comfortable position, and this is what you need to do at your computer workstation. It is usually recommended that every 25 to 30 minutes get up out of your chair, stretch and reseat yourself. Some of you will be in the types of jobs where you rarely get 20 minutes when you are not disturbed from your desk - so you will not have to worry about this.

			<text>It is particularly important to take breaks if you are working intensively. If you get engrossed in your work you may not notice discomfort until it is time to get up from your desk - like in the example of attending a talk or a meeting - if the session is boring you very quickly notice the discomfort of the seat, but if it is interesting you may not notice until you feel stiff getting up at the end. There are some free software programmes that you can download onto your computer that can provide you with prompts to take rest breaks, at intervals you define.

Even between rest breaks it is important to rest your eyes.

Try and look away from the screen every 3 or 4 minutes at something distant, so that your eyes are not constantly focusing on the screen.

			<text>The law requires employers to provide employees, who are display screen users, with a free eye test. If you wish to have such an eye test, you must contact Human Resources for a document that you will need to take with you to the optician.

The University will reimburse you the cost of the eye test and - if, as a result of the eye test, you require spectacles for your use of display screen equipment - a contribution towards the cost of the spectacles that should cover the cost of the standard lenses and a basic set of frames.

The eye test procedures for display screen equipment users can usually be found on the Human Resources intranet site and also on the Safety Services site.

			<text>If you use a laptop then you can't vary your screen to keyboard distance and because of this, unmodified laptops are not suitable for regular and routine long periods of use. However, modifying them is simple - at your main workstation you could have a docking station for the laptop or you could simply plug in a separate keyboard and mouse, set the laptop up on a stand and away you go.
Laptops
Laptops also cause manual handling problems, if you move them around a lot. Because they are bulky, carrying them in traditional laptop cases results in asymmetric lifting and loading of your body.

The use of a properly designed laptop backpack can address this problem.</text>

			<text>Consider how you are using your workstation and try making some adjustments. If the discomfort does not go away, ask for help. Safety Services can advise on adjustments that may help. What we don't want is discomfort that you are noticing while at work becoming discomfort that you begin noticing away from work.

If you do feel that you have such a problem, please email one of the Occupational Health Advisers - they can come and assess your workstation and advise your school or department on what measures of additional equipment may be needed to address your workstation problems.

			<text>You need to carry out an assessment of your workstation using the standard DSE Self-Assessment Form - which can usually be found on the Safety Services website. 

Run through the form and identify any deficiencies that your computer workstation has. When you have completed the form, please give one copy to your line manager (who may need to take action if, for example, any new equipment needs purchasing or your workstation needs moving) and also give one copy to your local Display Screen Assessor.

			<text>Your local Display Screen Assessor's role is to keep records of training and assessments and to prompt when someone hasn't done training or hasn't assessed their workstation.

The Display Screen Assessor can also help you carry out the assessment of your workstation - a second pair of eyes looking at a problem can often see something that we miss.
